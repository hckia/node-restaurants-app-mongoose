Green white and red.
Green represents Islam
White represents honesty and peace
Red represents bravery, as well as all the martyrs (in Shia Islam).

The Lion at the center of the Shirokorshid flag actually represents  two things - the Persian lion - now extinct in Iran, but still resides in India and Ali - which also means "lion of god"

The post-revolution flag has the Allah symbol, also saying "lā ilāha illā allāh" (...there is no god but Allāh...)
